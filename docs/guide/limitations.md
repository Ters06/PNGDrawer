# PNGDrawer - Known Limitations & Best Practices

This document outlines the known limitations of the current version of the `PNGDrawer` application. Understanding these constraints can help you avoid common issues. Each limitation is linked to a corresponding feature request in our backlog.

| Limitation                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Related Backlog Item                                                 |

| **Limited Connection Curve Control** | The `bend` property for curved edges offers limited control, making it difficult to create precise paths, especially for self-referencing loops. | [PD-008](./specs/PD-007.md) |
| **No Edge Label Styling** | While edges can have labels, they do not currently support the advanced styling options available to node labels (e.g., `font_weight`, `color`). They are rendered with the default font and color.                                                                   | [PD-007](./specs/PD-006.md) |
| **No Dedicated Tag/Overlay System** | The application does not have a built-in feature for adding corner tags or badges to nodes. **Workaround:** This can be achieved by creating a second, smaller shape and using relative placement to position it over the corner of the parent node. See the [Cookbook](./cookbook.md) for a detailed recipe. | [PD-003](./specs/PD-002.md)  |
| **Implicit Layering** | The stacking order of elements (which element appears on top) is determined by their order in the `nodes.json` array, not the `layer` property. **Workaround:** To place an element on top of another, ensure its definition comes *after* the element it should cover. | [PD-009](./specs/PD-008.md) |
