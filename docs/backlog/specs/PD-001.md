### 1. Problem Statement

When defining a `label` for a shape node, long strings of text do not automatically wrap to fit within the node's boundaries. This forces users to manually calculate where to insert newline characters (`\\\\n`) in their JSON definitions, which is tedious, error-prone, and not responsive to changes in node width.

### 2. Implemented Solution

The rendering engine was modified to automatically wrap text for `label` properties within shape nodes. The wrapping algorithm considers the node's width (minus a configurable padding) and the font metrics of the specified text.

New optional properties were added to the `label` object:

- `wrapping`: `"auto"` (default) enables automatic word wrapping. `"none"` disables it.
- `text_align`: `"left"`, `"center"` (default), or `"right"` controls the horizontal alignment of wrapped text.

### 3. Implementation Notes

- The text rendering logic in `drawer/addons/text.py` was updated.
- A `_wrap_text` helper function was created to calculate line breaks.
- The `_draw_node_label` function was updated to handle the `wrapping` and `text_align` properties, using `multiline_text` and `multiline_textbbox` from Pillow for rendering and positioning.
- The feature relies on a padding of `15px` (scaled) to prevent text from touching the node's edges.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

1.  Given a node with a `label` and `wrapping: "auto"`, the text wraps automatically to fit within the node's width. - **Met**
2.  Given a node with `wrapping: "none"`, text only wraps where a manual `\\\\n` is present. - **Met**
3.  The wrapping algorithm correctly handles words that are longer than the node's width. - **Met**
4.  The alignment of the wrapped text block respects the `text_align` property. - **Met**
