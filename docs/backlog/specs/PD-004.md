### 1. Problem Statement

The `label` object in a node definition did not have its own styling properties. The text color and font style were inherited from global settings, forcing workarounds to achieve simple effects like white text on a dark background.

### 2. Implemented Solution

The `label` object was enhanced to accept its own styling properties, which override any global text styles. A global `default_font_size` was also added to `main.json`.

**New properties for the `label` object:**
- `color`: Sets the font color for the specific label.
- `font_weight`: `normal`, `bold`.
- `font_style`: `normal`, `italic`.
- `font_size`: A specific integer font size.

### 3. Implementation Notes

- The `NodeObject` and `EdgeObject` classes in `drawer/models/` were updated to explicitly store the `label` object from their configuration.
- The `_get_font` helper function in `drawer/addons/text.py` was created. It uses `subprocess` and `fc-match` to find appropriate system fonts based on the requested family, weight, and style.
- The `_draw_node_label` function now uses these properties to render the text with the correct styling.
- The `ImageRenderer` in `generator.py` was updated to read `default_font_size` from `main.json`.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

1.  Given a `label` object with a `color` property, the rendered text uses that color. - **Met**
2.  If the `color` property is omitted, the text uses the default global text color (`#000000`). - **Met**
3.  The `font_weight` and `font_style` properties are correctly applied to the rendered text. - **Met**
4.  The `font_size` property in a label overrides the new `default_font_size` from `main.json`. - **Met**
