### 1. Problem Statement

The stacking order of elements is currently determined by their order of appearance in the `nodes.json` array. While a `layer` property exists on nodes, it is not currently used by the rendering engine, which is counter-intuitive. This "implicit" layering can lead to confusion and makes it difficult to manage complex diagrams where elements must be guaranteed to appear on top of others.

### 2. Proposed Solution

Make the `layer` property functional. The rendering engine should sort all drawable objects based on their `layer` value before executing the drawing addons. Objects with a higher `layer` value will be drawn on top of objects with a lower value.

### 3. Technical Details

- In `drawer/generator.py`, before the addon loop in the `render` method, the `self.drawable_objects` list should be sorted.
- The sort key should be the `layer` attribute of each object.
- A default `layer` value (e.g., `1`) should be assumed if the property is not present in an object's configuration.

```python
# In generator.py, before the addon loop:
self.drawable_objects.sort(key=lambda obj: obj.layer or 1)
```

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

1.  Given two overlapping nodes, the node with the higher `layer` value is always rendered on top, regardless of its position in the `nodes.json` array.
2.  Nodes without an explicit `layer` property default to a base layer (e.g., 1) and are rendered underneath nodes with a `layer` of 2 or higher.
3.  The change does not negatively impact the rendering of edges or other diagram components.
