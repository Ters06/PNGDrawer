### 1. Problem Statement

The current `connection` object for edges uses a `bend` factor for `"curve"` and `"s-curve"` types. This is not intuitive and provides limited control over the exact path of the line. It is particularly difficult to create clean, aesthetically pleasing loops for self-referencing nodes.

### 2. Proposed Solution

Enhance the `connection` object to support a more explicit method of defining curves, likely by specifying one or more control points for a Bézier curve.

**Proposed `connection` object enhancement:**

```json
"connection": {
    "type": "bezier",
    "control_points": [
        [ "20%", "50%" ], // Control point 1: 20% of the distance along X, 50% along Y
        [ "80%", "-50%" ] // Control point 2: 80% along X, -50% along Y (creating an arc)
    ]
}
```
This would provide much more granular control over the shape of the connection line. The coordinates could be relative percentages of the distance between the source and target anchors.

### 3. Technical Details

- The `Edge` addon in `drawer/addons/edge.py` would need a new drawing handler for the `"bezier"` connection type.
- The handler would need to parse the `control_points` array.
- It would calculate the absolute pixel coordinates for the control points based on the source and target anchor points.
- It would use Pillow's `ImageDraw` capabilities to draw a cubic Bézier curve from the source anchor to the target anchor using the calculated control points.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

1.  An edge with `connection.type: "bezier"` is drawn as a smooth curve influenced by the `control_points`.
2.  The control point coordinates are correctly interpreted as relative distances between the start and end points of the edge.
3.  The system gracefully falls back to the existing `curve` and `s-curve` logic if the `bezier` type is not used.
4.  A self-referencing node can be made to have a clean, circular loop using this new method.
