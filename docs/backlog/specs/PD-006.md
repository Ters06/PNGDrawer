### 1. Problem Statement

The current workflow for creating diagrams is entirely code-based, requiring users to manually write and edit multiple JSON files. While powerful for developers, this presents a steep learning curve for non-technical users and can be slow for rapid prototyping.

### 2. Proposed Solution

Develop a web-based, interactive WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for creating and modifying PNGDrawer diagrams.

**Core Features:**
- A canvas area where users can drag and drop nodes.
- A toolbar for adding new shapes, text, and icons.
- An inspector panel to edit the properties (size, color, label, etc.) of a selected element.
- The ability to draw edges by clicking and dragging between node anchor points.
- An "Export" button that generates the complete set of `nodes.json`, `edges.json`, and `canvas.json` files based on the current state of the visual editor.
- An "Import" feature to load an existing set of JSON files onto the canvas.

### 3. Technical Details

- **Frontend:** A JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js would be suitable. A library like `react-flow` or `d3.js` could be used to handle the interactive canvas.
- **Backend:** A simple Python backend (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) would be needed to serve the web application and potentially handle the JSON file generation and zipping for download.
- The frontend state would mirror the structure of the JSON definition files, making the export process a simple matter of serializing the state.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

1.  Users can add, move, and resize nodes on a visual canvas.
2.  Users can edit node properties through a UI panel, and the changes are reflected instantly.
3.  Users can create and modify edges between nodes.
4.  The editor can export a valid set of JSON definition files that can be rendered by the existing `PNGDrawer` Python script.
5.  The editor can successfully import and display a diagram from an existing set of valid JSON files.
