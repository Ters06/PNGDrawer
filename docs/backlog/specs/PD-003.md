### 1. Problem Statement

To add an "Out of scope" tag to a node, we had to create a separate shape node, carefully calculate its relative position to overlap the corner, and manage its layering. This is a cumbersome and unintuitive workaround for a common requirement.

### 2. Proposed Solution

Introduce a new `overlays` array property for shape nodes. This array will allow users to define simple, styled tags that are automatically positioned at the corners of the parent node.

Each overlay object in the array would have properties like:
- `text`: The text to display.
- `position`: `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`.
- `background_color`: The background color of the tag.
- `text_color`: The color of the tag's text.
- `font_size`: The font size.

### 3. Technical Details

- The `drawer/models/node.py` will be updated to include the `overlays` property.
- The main rendering loop in `drawer/generator.py` will iterate through the `overlays` array after drawing the main node.
- For each overlay, it will draw a new small, rounded rectangle and its text label at the specified corner, overlapping the parent node. The layer of the overlay will be `parent_node.layer + 1`.

**Example `nodes.json` modification:**

```json
{
    "id": "recommend_box_4",
    "type": "shape",
    "shape": "rounded_rectangle",
    "size": [ 380, 100 ],
    "label": { "text": "Cycles de rem√©diation suivants" },
    "overlays": [
        {
            "text": "Out of scope",
            "position": "top_left",
            "background_color": "#F8D7DA",
            "text_color": "#D9534F"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

1.  Given a node with an `overlays` array, each overlay is rendered as a tag at the specified corner.
2.  The tag correctly overlaps the parent node's corner.
3.  The styling (colors, font) of the tag is applied as defined in the overlay object.
4.  Multiple overlays can be added to a single node at different corners.
